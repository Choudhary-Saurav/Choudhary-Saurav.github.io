            <h2>Building genome, studying cells and mapping spaces for <i>Hymenolepis diminuta</i></h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                This is a collaborative, multi-aim project with <strong>Dr. Tania Rozario</strong> and <strong>Dr. Casey Bergman</strong>, focused on building foundational genomic and single-cell resources for <i>H. diminuta</i> and using them to better understand regeneration and stem cell biology in tapeworms.
                <br><br>
                First part of the project focuses on generating the first end-to-end, fully annotated chromosome-level reference genome for <i>H. diminuta</i>. We are using PacBio long-read (HiFi) sequencing along with modern assembly and annotation pipelines to produce a high-quality genome that can serve as a reliable reference for future studies and provide insights into chromosome evolution in platyhelminths.
                <br><br>
                Second part is to build a comprehensive single-cell atlas of <i>H. diminuta</i> to map its cellular composition and explore heterogeneity within the stem cell population in the germinative region. By applying single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq approaches, we aim to characterize diverse stem cell states linked to the parasite’s regenerative ability and discover novel cell subtypes. This resource will support research in planarian biology and parasitology, and may help establish <i>H. diminuta</i> as a useful model for studying human tapeworm infections.
                <br><br>
                Final part uses spatial transcriptomics to reveal where key genes are expressed and to define the microenvironment (niche) of stem cells in the germinative region. This will help us understand how stem cell behavior is influenced by surrounding signals, with the goal of identifying novel pluripotent stem cell populations or uncovering how multiple stem cell types and their environments may exhibit pluripotent behavior under specific niche conditions.

            <h2>Linking Genetic Risk to Cellular Function: A Single-Cell Approach to Understanding PUFA Metabolism</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                This project focuses on understanding how genetic variation influences fatty acid traits and how these signals connect to specific cell types and biological pathways. Using large-scale human genomics data, We integrate GWAS summary statistics with atlas-level single-cell datasets to move from “association signals” to more interpretable biology—identifying the cell types, genes, and regulatory programs most relevant to PUFA metabolism. The goal is to pinpoint where these traits are controlled in the body and highlight candidate mechanisms that could explain why individuals differ in fatty acid levels and related metabolic outcomes.
                <br><br>
                To achieve this, we work with single-cell RNA-seq , scATAC-seq datasets and spatial transcriptomics and apply computational frameworks that combine trait genetics with cell-type resolution. This includes building clean, reproducible pipelines for quality control, annotation, and downstream analysis, and generating results that are easy to interpret through clear visualizations and summaries. Ultimately, this project aims to provide a deeper, cell-type–specific view of PUFA biology and create a foundation for future work linking genetic variation to metabolic health and disease risk.
